This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Railway Storage Bucket Configuration

This project uses **Railway Storage Buckets** for file storage (S3-compatible). Set the following environment variables:

```bash
# Railway Storage Bucket (required for file uploads)
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name          # or BUCKET
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key    # or ACCESS_KEY_ID  
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret    # or SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
S3_ENDPOINT=https://storage.railway.app
S3_REGION=auto
```

Get these credentials from your Railway bucket's **Credentials** tab after creating a bucket in your Railway project.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
